NEW VERSION

The premise of the exploit is:

- embed the badblocker page in an iframe so that we can control the nested iframe

- set the url to a page with 2 iframes to set the initial length of ads to 2

- the viewer will read the length = 2 and then clear both of those frames

- there is a csp that stops the navigation from going to /blocked.html - this means that the sameOriginCheck will timeout

- during this timeout, navigate the parent of the 2 iframes to point to the import-history page, which has a prototype pollution vulnerability

- as the viewer and the index page are same origin, the viewer can access the prototype polluted variables, and contentWindow[1] can be polluted (as it doesnt exist, there isnt an iframe) to any length we want

- the length is saved to localStorage, which is inserted directly into innerHTML

- win
